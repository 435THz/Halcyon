	--It's already night when you arrive. Penticus is pacing around nervously wondering where you are before he realizes you're here
	--He runs up to hyko relieved and asks wtf happened. He went through the dungeon since it got late and you guys weren't here when he arrived.
	--You explain and he's super concerned that you had to fight an entire clan of Slugma.
	--He's impressed that you did it, and thanks the player team for doing a good job but he tells hyko that he pretty much had a panic attack wondering where he was and wants him to stay close for the rest of the expedition.
	--Hyko protests but eventually gives in seeing how worked up Penticus is. Penticus isn't acting entirely out of character, but obviously this is 
	--Phileas will explain at one point that the reason he and Penticus didn't find you when coming through the dungeon once it started late was probably because of how mystery dungeons shift. They're different everytime, it probably caused them to be brought a different way and so they didnt find you.
	
	--Partner at some point could say something like "I'd be really worked up too if something happened to player!". Player may be able to say something similar back. Could be laying it on too thick?

	--Later on, I was thinking of having Almotz/Rin/Coco kinda like, limp into camp after Windswept because they really struggled with it, and maybe they needed a save from Penticus for this, but this
	--may be a bit too drastic or rough on them. The expedition shouldn't be TOO depressing...
