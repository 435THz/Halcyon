--dummy file, for now.
--This dummy file is needed to override the base game's upgrade service. Prevents a bug save files that had Halcyon mods on, saved, mods toggled off, then reloaded.
--OnUpgrade in debug_tools' init.lua will still be called as previously expected. Continue to add on upgrade stuff there.
