V 0.3.0,
Initial public demo release. 



V 0.4.0
- Improved outlaw spawning code from Trio-
- Fixed Domi Blend displaying a belly fill message (it should do that silently)
- Fixed Apple Cider NOT displaying a belly fill message (it should say your belly was filled)
- Added a new UI to the cafe drink system that should be much more convenient for players.
- Added a new drink to the cafe that unlocks in Chapter 4. Endurance Tonic costs a Reviver Seed and a Chesto Berry and gives the consumer 5 turns of Endure status, preventing their HP from going below 1. Unlike the usual endure effect given by the move, this one is not cleared by moving.
- Two new training mazes unlock in Chapter 4, Flying and Rock.
- Lars will now sell colored and plain Apricorns once Chapter 4 starts. He'll sell one guaranteed a day. 
- Rhizo will also have a chance to sell plain and colored Apricorns once Chapter 4 starts.
- Fixed Water Maze's element being Fire and not Water.
- Espurr, Meowth-A, Popplio, Charcadet, and Tepig, Zorua-H are added as starters. Check pokemon changes file to see some changes to Espurr's and Charcadet's level up table, as well as the changes to Zorua-H.
- Fixed a bug where a client pokemon with temporary water privileges (i.e. water sport) being beamed out while on water caused an error.
- Adjusted logic for turning towards a specified location, this should make certain scripted character turns better at looking in the proper direction when turning to look at a location.
- Fixed a number of minor typos.
- Time Gear Remix has been replaced with an original composition by Minemaker0430. Thank you again!
- Hunger seeds in Crooked Cavern have been replaced with Decoy seeds. These should help with the unique challenges that dungeon provides.
- Slightly reduced the first boss leader's stats.
- Significantly reduced a certain Hypnosis user's Speed stat. This will make her more likely to miss her Hypnosis as well as easier to land attacks on.
- Adjusted a certain moron's stat EVs. This ends up giving him less Atk and Sp. Atk, but more Speed, Def. and Sp. Def.
- Changed some starter movesets around a bit to allow certain mons to get STAB moves earlier on. Check pokemon changes file for details.
- Added a QoL message that warns you when leaving a floor with an incomplete job.
- Improve Fleeing Outlaw AI to be less cheesable.
- The range at which certain enemies are allowed to use moves from has been reduced. This should prevent unfair sniping from certain enemies early on in the game.
- Added scarf sprites for Mudkip. It seems I had accidentially passed over him when I first added all the scarf pokemon I had sprites for.
- Added certain actions that happen mid sentence, now that the [script] tag is available. This has been added throughout the game here and there, where appropriate. Typically used to have a character hop at the end of a sentence.
- Added plot-based goals to Mission Objectives, ala Explorers. If you're in the current story dungeon, Mission Objectives now has a non-generic line telling you what the objective is instead of just "Go as far as you can."
- Power Band, Def. Scarf, Special Band, and Zinc Band all boost their respective stat by 20% now instead of 10%.
- Fixed a bug where Exploration missions didn't have their difficulty increased.
- Lowered base price of Stayaway Orb from 150 to 50.
- Nerfed gummi spawn rates in shops, the cafe, and mission rewards by about half. Dungeon rates are unchanged, but may be adjusted in the future.
- Added the ability to eat gummis and stat boosters in the overworld (thank you Trio-)
- Added a new Adventuring Tip to Almotz's almanac.
- Revamped internal logic for Cafe Specials and added a more updated system for determining which item to pick.
- Fixed a display bug in the pokemon's info menu when a scarf sprite was being used.
- Fixed Kecleon's not leaning over their counter when talking to them.
- Fixed fail result in Relic Forest not giving a results screen.
- Added a Store All option to Kanga in town.
- Fixed a display bug for Apple Cider in the ferment prompt.
- Fixed a bug where outlaws would spawn with no moves.
- Fixed cheri bombs not working due to a PMDO issue.
- Tweaked some wording in the cafe to prevent an issue where you'd get "a (vowel)" on fermented item get.
- Fixed an issue where finishing/losing in Ledian Dojo would cause the ground to not setup in the same way that it would had you entered in the map from the ladder.
- Fixed an issue where generic win/lose scenes in Ledian Dojo would cause background NPCs to not animate correctly.
