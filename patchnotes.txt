First Chapter 2 demo patch, v0.1.1:

-Removed 14 starters due to balancing concerns.
-Moved Coco's location in Chapter 1 so she can't block the hallway by accident.
-Fixed a bug where Ezalor would play his idle animation instead of no animation after helping learn or delete a move.
-Removed fee for relearning moves.
-Changed reference to "paying a fee" to "For no cost at all" in Ezalor's info dialogue.
-Adjusted moves of some mons in Illuminant Riverbed so you don't get spammed as much from a distance. Should make it easier/more managable. Some mons still retain bubble or water gun however.
-Changed some partner interact dialogue to better reflect that they knew the ladder was there but just never went down as opposed to just never actually seeing the ladder to the dojo.
-Added day 1 chapter 2 partner speak interaction when in the housing area so that they make note of the numel cutscene if you've seen it happen.
-Adjusted some camera work when meeting Lotus to keep the characters more centered in the camera.
-Changed plural references to Synergy Scarf from Synergy Scarf to Synergy Scarves.
-Penticus now lets you know the scarves cannot be lost by fainting when he gives them to you.
-Added a warning when picking a hero and partner of the same primary type.
-Added Alolan Vulpix as a starter.
-Changed Vulpix's starting egg move from Extrasensory to Tail Slap as it gets extrasensory on lvlup.
-Removed Illusion from Zorua. Gave it Keen Eye as a replacement ability. Illusion was too strong. I am open to other, slightly better abilities as a replacement too.
-Removed an duplicated question mark from character selection.


v0.1.2
-fixed a issue where getting a warning for picking same type hero/partner, then going back and choosing a different one of a different type would cause an infinite loop.



v0.1.3
-Adjusted Rowlet's egg move from Ominous Wind to Confuse Ray.
-Gave Rowlett Vine Whip at level 1 as a replacement for leafage which is not implemented. Leafage is removed from the learnset as a result.
-Added some missing commas in Relic Forest Part 2's defeat cutscene.
-Fixed a grammar issue when playing as a nonbinary hero in relic forest's meeting cutscene.
-Zorua's egg move changed from extrasensory to Copycat.
-Scorbunny's egg move changed from sucker punch to assurance 
-Bulbasaur's egg move changed from knock off to sludge 
-chikorita's egg move changed from ancient power to refresh 
-froakie's egg move changed from power up punch to mud sport 
-Vulpix-A lvl 1 powder snow changed to ice shard. Ice shard at level 10 removed. It no longer learns powder snow.
-Some of Penticus's lines have been tweaked to make him sound more casual.
-Reduced the volunteer Dugtrio's attack stat significantly in the dojo lesson to prevent him from KOing the player if the player gets handsy with him. It's a lesson on recruitment after all, he shouldn't be busting heads.
-adjusted some dialogue in Katrine's shop to read better.
-fixed a typo with one of Nama's dialogues.
--fixed banker dialogue so that he would say you'd lose all your money instead of only half.
-Fixed overflow of text in Phileas's dialogue regarding Synergy scarves.
-Fixed a number of minor typos and punctuation mistakes in dialogue in chapter 2.
--turned down the volume of "File Select" song that plays in Altere Pond. I'm not an audacity wiz, so please keep an ear out and let me know if it's still too loud, too soft, sounds weird, etc.
