V 0.3.0,
Initial public demo release. 



V 0.4.0
- Improved outlaw spawning code from Trio-
- Fixed Domi Blend displaying a belly fill message (it should do that silently)
- Fixed Apple Cider NOT displaying a belly fill message (it should say your belly was filled)
- Added a new UI to the cafe drink system that should be much more convenient for players.
- Added a new drink to the cafe that unlocks in Chapter 4. Endurance Tonic costs a Reviver Seed and a Chesto Berry and gives the consumer 5 turns of Endure status, preventing their HP from going below 1. Unlike the usual endure effect given by the move, this one is not cleared by moving.
- Two new training mazes unlock in Chapter 4, Flying and Rock.
- Lars will now sell colored and plain Apricorns once Chapter 4 begins. He'll sell one guaranteed a day. 
- Rhizo will also have a chance to sell plain and colored Apricorns once Chapter 4 begins.
- Fixed Water Maze's element being Fire and not Water.
- Espurr, Meowth-A, Popplio, and Tepig are added as starters. Check pokemon changes file to see some changes to Espurr's level up table.
- Fixed a bug where a client pokemon with temporary water privileges (i.e. water sport) being beamed out while on water caused an error.
- Adjusted logic for turning towards a specified location, this should make certain scripted character turns better at looking in the proper direction when turning to look at a location.
- Fixed a number of minor typos.
- Time Gear Remix has been replaced with an original composition by Minemaker0430. Thank you again!
- Hunger seeds in Crooked Cavern have been replaced with Decoy seeds. These should help with the unique challenges that dungeon provides.
- Slightly reduced the first boss leader's stats.
- Significantly reduced a certain Hypnosis user's Speed stat. This will make her more likely to miss her Hypnosis as well as easier to land attacks on.
- Adjusted a certain moron's stat EVs. This ends up giving him less Atk and Sp. Atk, but more Speed, Def. and Sp. Def.
- Changed some starter movesets around a bit to allow certain mons to get STAB moves earlier on. Check pokemon changes file for details.
- Added a QoL message that warns you when leaving a floor with an incomplete job.
- Improve Fleeing Outlaw AI to be less cheesable.
- The range at which certain enemies are allowed to use moves from has been reduced. This should prevent unfair sniping from certain enemies early on in the game.
- Added scarf sprites for Mudkip. It seems I had accidentially passed over him when I first added all the scarf pokemon I had sprites for.
