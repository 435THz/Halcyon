First Chapter 2 demo patch, v0.1.1:

-Removed 14 starters due to balancing concerns.
-Moved Coco's location in Chapter 1 so she can't block the hallway by accident.
-Fixed a bug where Ezalor would play his idle animation instead of no animation after helping learn or delete a move.
-Removed fee for relearning moves.
-Changed reference to "paying a fee" to "For no cost at all" in Ezalor's info dialogue.
-Adjusted moves of some mons in Illuminant Riverbed so you don't get spammed as much from a distance. Should make it easier/more managable. Some mons still retain bubble or water gun however.
-Changed some partner interact dialogue to better reflect that they knew the ladder was there but just never went down as opposed to just never actually seeing the ladder to the dojo.
-Added day 1 chapter 2 partner speak interaction when in the housing area so that they make note of the numel cutscene if you've seen it happen.
-Adjusted some camera work when meeting Lotus to keep the characters more centered in the camera.
-Changed plural references to Synergy Scarf from Synergy Scarf to Synergy Scarves.
-Penticus now lets you know the scarves cannot be lost by fainting when he gives them to you.
-Added a warning when picking a hero and partner of the same primary type.
-Added Alolan Vulpix as a starter.
-Changed Vulpix's starting egg move from Extrasensory to Tail Slap as it gets extrasensory on lvlup.
-Removed Illusion from Zorua. Gave it Keen Eye as a replacement ability. Illusion was too strong. I am open to other, slightly better abilities as a replacement too.
-Removed an duplicated question mark from character selection.


v0.1.2
-fixed a issue where getting a warning for picking same type hero/partner, then going back and choosing a different one of a different type would cause an infinite loop.



v0.1.3
-Adjusted Rowlet's egg move from Ominous Wind to Confuse Ray.
-Gave Rowlett Vine Whip at level 1 as a replacement for leafage which is not implemented. Leafage is removed from the learnset as a result.
-Added some missing commas in Relic Forest Part 2's defeat cutscene.
-Fixed a grammar issue when playing as a nonbinary hero in relic forest's meeting cutscene.
-Zorua's egg move changed from extrasensory to Copycat.
-Scorbunny's egg move changed from sucker punch to assurance 
-Bulbasaur's egg move changed from knock off to sludge 
-chikorita's egg move changed from ancient power to refresh 
-froakie's egg move changed from power up punch to mud sport 
-Vulpix-A lvl 1 powder snow changed to ice shard. Ice shard at level 10 removed. It no longer learns powder snow.
-Some of Penticus's lines have been tweaked to make him sound more casual.
-Reduced the volunteer Dugtrio's attack stat significantly in the dojo lesson to prevent him from KOing the player if the player gets handsy with him. It's a lesson on recruitment after all, he shouldn't be busting heads.
-adjusted some dialogue in Katrine's shop to read better.
-fixed a typo with one of Nama's dialogues.
--fixed banker dialogue so that he would say you'd lose all your money instead of only half.
-Fixed overflow of text in Phileas's dialogue regarding Synergy scarves.
-Fixed a number of minor typos and punctuation mistakes in dialogue in chapter 2.
--turned down the volume of "File Select" song that plays in Altere Pond. I'm not an audacity wiz, so please keep an ear out and let me know if it's still too loud, too soft, sounds weird, etc.



v0.1.4
-Updated Audino sprites to new version on repo. Baroness Faron was also kind enough to specifically create eating and posing animations while facing upwards so Rin will now no longer use placeholder animations in relevant cutscenes!
-Removed most sprites from mod folder and all portraits. Audino updated the base game to be up to date on these, so including them in the mod is redundant. Some mons remain modified (namely guild mons, and kec for purp kec) for their custom guild animations.
-Removed some scripting that set Ledian's animation to idle in several places as base game behavior now sets flying mons to idle rather than none in cutscenes. Leaving those idle animation settings in would have been redundant
-fixed some flowers in metano town that were not animated 
-removed an inappropriate debug print that I had missed when originally removing some debug prints.
-added a save and quit prompt between chapter 1's end and chapter 2's start. The quitting does not work so well right now, but I think audino needs to fix that, not me. 
-also adjusted some of the pauses in the chapter 1 end / chapter 2 start cutscenes to help accomodate the newly added save and quit prompt.
-Removed some superfluous items from the beginner lesson.
-added tackle to cubone at level 1 so it starts with an actual attack besides its egg move.
-added missing punctuation to one of Zigs's selling lines.
-You can now throw a dollar into the wishing well to make a wish. Please note that this doesn't do anything besides you lose a dollar. Happy wishing!
-Added generic endings to Relic Forest and Illimunant riverbed. they should even work in "chapter 3" now if you want to mess around post demo!
-Adjusted some pauses here and there to make transitions better, particularly with generic dinner times.
-adjusted when results screen would show up after leaving a dungeon. Right now, it'll show up if you faint in non dojo dungeons, or if you beat non dojo dungeons outside of the storyline (there is no special cutscene to play next that would mean)
-added BGM fade outs to a number of scene transitions where it seemed appropriate so music transitions are less abrupt. Keep an ear out and let me know if you think anything sounds awkward or should be adjusted?
-removed chapter 1's mention of "deja vu" in final cutscene as I think it's too strong of a tip off and totally thematically appropriate. (strange feelings are the better way to go)
-fixed a layering issue in relic forest (objects under and objects were swapped)
-todo: fix torches on fire house
