Halcyon is a mod for PMDO created by Palika that is essentially its own brand new PMD game. 

Please keep it under wraps until I go public with it. This will happen when enough work has been done to release a demo. 
The first one will be after the 3rd chapter (first outlaw job).

Credits:
Palika - scripting, writing, balancing, etc. (all non-engine work)
Audino - for making the engine, adding features that I needed for the game

Edan Momu - guild exterior and partial interior sprite work
D4yz - guild interior tilesets and original guild decorations pixel art
Jaifain - Eating and Posing sprites for Growlithe, Breloom, Noctowl, Tropius, Snubbull, Cranidos, Girafarig, and Zigzagoon


Special thanks:
borzoiteeth - for inspiring the game in the first place
