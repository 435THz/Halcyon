Halcyon is a mod for PMDO created by Palika that aims to recapture the vibes and energy of Explorers.
It currently consists of 3 chapters. 
A final length of 8-12 chapters is currently planned.

To install and play:
1. Download and install PMDO if you have not already. PMDO can be downloaded here: https://github.com/audinowho/PMDODump/releases
2. Download Halcyon as a zip file via the provided download link or on its github. For github, master branch is the latest stable version,
while working-copy is the latest, unstable and potentially incomplete build. Other branches are old and outdated and probably won't work right.
Github link: https://github.com/Palikadude/Halcyon
3. Extract the Halcyon zip file.
4. Place extracted Halcyon folder into PMDO's MODS folder. The exact file path changes depending on where you put PMDO, but it should go something like PMDO/MODS/Halcyon in the end.
5. Make sure Halcyon is not embedded an extra folder down! When you click on Halcyon's folder in your MODS folder, it should have the readme file in plain sight, and not in another folder!
6. Start PMDO, and select Halcyon from the main menu via Special Episodes.
